# CPP Samples

Objective of this repo to have some handy functions which are frequently used in c++ or computer vision in general.

This is to have an overview of the basics which are mostly provided by 3rd party libraries such as OpenCV, Eigen or Ceres

For custom implementation of computer vision features. Structures from OpenCV are used and also the framework from OpenCV is used to load and display an image.

## Computer Vision functions
* Gaussian Blur
* Median Filter
* Canny Edge
* Hough transform
* Erode -tbd

## Drawing functions
* Line drawing
* Circle drawing
* Rectangle drawing
* Polygon drawing

## Algorithms
* 2D line fitting using RANSAC
* 3D line fitting using RANSAC
* Singly linked list
* Doubly linked list

## Optimization
Module to implement basic optimization techniques like gauss newton, levenberg Marquadt etc

## C++14 basics
Code snippets to understand c++11 and above features

## Programming tools
* Simple google test example
* File io operation
