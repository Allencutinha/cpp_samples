## Computational Geometry

Computational geometry is a field of computer science that deals with the design and analysis of algorithms for solving geometric problems. Some of the topics that are typically included in computational geometry are:

### Point location

 Given a set of points in the plane and a query point, determine which point in the set is closest to the query point.

### Convex hull

Given a set of points in the plane, find the smallest convex polygon that encloses all of the points.

### Line segment intersection

Given a set of line segments in the plane, determine which segments intersect.

### Polygon triangulation

Given a polygon, divide it into a set of triangles.

### Voronoi diagrams

Given a set of points in the plane, partition the plane into regions such that each region consists of all points that are closer to a particular point in the set than any other point.

### Intersection of geometric objects

Given a set of geometric objects, such as circles, rectangles, or polygons, determine which objects intersect.

### Motion planning

Given a set of obstacles in the plane and a starting and ending point, find a path that avoids the obstacles and connects the starting and ending points.
