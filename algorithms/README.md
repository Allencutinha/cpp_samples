Computational geometry is a field of computer science that deals with the design and analysis of algorithms for solving geometric problems. Some of the topics that are typically included in computational geometry are:

* __Point location__ : Given a set of points in the plane and a query point, determine which point in the set is closest to the query point.

* __Convex hull__ : Given a set of points in the plane, find the smallest convex polygon that encloses all of the points.

*  __Line segment intersection__ : Given a set of line segments in the plane, determine which segments intersect.

* __Polygon triangulation__ : Given a polygon, divide it into a set of triangles.

* __Voronoi diagrams__ : Given a set of points in the plane, partition the plane into regions such that each region consists of all points that are closer to a particular point in the set than any other point.

* __Intersection of geometric objects__ : Given a set of geometric objects, such as circles, rectangles, or polygons, determine which objects intersect.

* __Motion planning__ : Given a set of obstacles in the plane and a starting and ending point, find a path that avoids the obstacles and connects the starting and ending points.
